<h1>Herring and Pumkin Pot Pie</h1>

<img src="../images/fishpie.jpeg" alt="Fish Pie">

<p>The highly regarded Studio Ghibli film <em>Kiki's Delivery Service</em> is a coming-of-age story filled with delicious- looking food. Rest assured; the pie being ill received by one of the characters is merely a plot point to expand on the theme of self-acceptance.  
    Many have found the white fish baked in a creamy bechamel sauce layered with cheese and puff pastry to be a tasty addition to their fall baking repertoire.</p>

<p><h2><b>Instructions</b></h2></p>

<ol>
    <li>Scoop out the seeds from the kabocha.</li>
    <li>Cut the kabocha into smaller pieces. Steam until softened (about 15 minutes).</li>
    <li>Remove the skin of the kabocha. Place kabocha pieces into a medium sized bowl.</li>
    <li>Finely chop the onion. In a medium pan, heat oil on medium. Cook the onions until translucent.</li>
    <li>Add the onion to the kabocha and mix, while making sure to break up the kabocha well.</li>
    </ol>

<p>Start on the bechamel sauce:</p>

<ol>
    <li>In a small saucepan, heat the butter on medium-low heat.</li>
    <li>Once melted, whisk in 2 tbsp flour until it bubbles (make sure not to burn it).</li>
    <li>Take your hot milk and pour it in and continue to whisk.</li>
    <li>Add salt and pepper to taste and whisk until the sauce thickens.</li>

<p>Back to the pot pie:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Add the bechamel sauce to the kabocha mixture in the bowl. Mix well â€“ until creamy.</li>
    <li>Add salt & pepper to taste.</li>
    <li>Transfer the mixture into a casserole dish.</li>
    <li>Open up the canned herring and place on top of the kabocha mixture.</li>
    <li>Place shredded white cheese or grate white cheese on top of the herring.</li>
    <li>Prep a sheet of puff pastry dough. This can be pre-made or you can make it from scratch.</li>
    <li>Place a thin sheet of puff pastry dough over to cover the casserole. You can cut it to fit the casserole or let it hang over the edges.</li>
    <li>Using another sheet of puff pastry dough, cut out the fish design and place it on top of the casserole.</li>
    <li>Mix your egg wash ingredients. Put egg wash onto the dough, being careful not to create any pools.</li>
    <li>Place cut olives around the edge of the dish.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bake the pot pie for 25-30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
